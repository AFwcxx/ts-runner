# runner
An executable unit test program for typescript node project that make sense to me.

## Usage

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev github:AFwcxx/runner
```

Declare in a file:

```javascript
import { Runner, Baton, Process } from "runner";
```

And then you can refer to [this test](src/test.ts).
